 #about project*
 WebTime Tracker is a powerful yet user-friendly productivity tool designed to help individuals and teams gain better control over their online time management. The system consists of two main components: a Chrome extension that actively monitors browsing activity and a backend server that securely stores and organizes the collected data for long-term analysis. By automatically tracking time spent on different websites and categorizing them as productive, unproductive, or neutral, the tool provides valuable insights into digital habits, helping users make informed decisions about their internet usage.

The Chrome extension operates seamlessly in the background, requiring no manual input from the user. It intelligently detects browsing activity by monitoring tab switches, page updates, and idle states, ensuring accurate time tracking without disrupting workflow. The extension uses Chrome's storage API to temporarily store session data before syncing it with the backend server, maintaining performance while preserving data integrity. When users click the extension icon, they are presented with a clean, easy-to-read popup that displays a detailed breakdown of their browsing history. The interface highlights productive and unproductive time in distinct sections, with time formatted in minutes and seconds for quick comprehension. Predefined lists of productive sites (like GitHub and Stack Overflow) and unproductive sites (like YouTube and Facebook) allow for automatic categorization, though the system remains flexible enough to accommodate custom preferences.

On the backend, a robust Node.js server powered by Express and Prisma ensures reliable data handling. The server connects to a Neon database, providing a scalable solution for storing time-tracking data. API endpoints enable seamless communication between the extension and the server, supporting features like saving time entries and retrieving historical data. The backend is designed with error handling and logging to maintain stability, making it suitable for both individual users and teams who need to track productivity across multiple accounts. User-specific data storage ensures privacy and personalization, allowing each user to access their own browsing statistics without interference from others.

Beyond basic time tracking, WebTime Tracker offers deeper insights by analyzing trends over days, weeks, or months. Users can identify patterns in their behavior, such as peak productive hours or frequent distractions, and adjust their habits accordingly. The tool is particularly useful for remote workers, students, and freelancers who want to optimize their online efficiency. With its intuitive design and powerful backend, WebTime Tracker bridges the gap between passive browsing and active time management, encouraging a healthier, more productive digital lifestyle. Whether used for self-improvement or team accountability, this tool provides the data needed to make meaningful changes in how time is spent online.

The project's modular structure makes it easy to extend with additional features, such as customizable site categories, detailed analytics dashboards, or integration with productivity apps. Its open architecture allows developers to adapt the system for different use cases, from personal goal-setting to workplace productivity monitoring. By combining real-time tracking with long-term data analysis, WebTime Tracker delivers a comprehensive solution for anyone looking to take control of their digital habits and maximize their online efficiency.
